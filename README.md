# King's Court: Jest or Share

## Spread joy and become king for a day!

- **Play Time (estimate):** 
  
  - `((N * 5 * R) + (M * 2 * R) + X) / 60` **hours**
  
  - **N** ⇒ _number of players_, **M** ⇒ _number of players with accessibility needs_
  
  - **X** ⇒ _total preparation time for game setup_
  
  - **R** ⇒ _number of rounds_ **[3 rounds recommended]**
  
  - **5 minutes** for presentation, **7 minutes** for players with accessibility needs
  
  - Approximate play time (3 rounds, no accessibility time): 0.5 to 2.5 hours

- **Number of Players:** `6 ± 3`

- **Credits:**
  
  - Virtual points that players can track on a piece of paper (resets each round)
  
  - The king is the one to keep tally. The pen and paper signifies his royal position

- **Plot:**
  
  - _It is the king's court. The king and his ministers sit at a roundtable; a grim frown on all of their faces. The royal jester has fallen ill, leaving the king's court without humour. Tense, the king looks at one of his ministers and sternly inquires - "Jest or Share?" Stunned, the minister looks at king confused, furrowing his brow. The others exchange worried glances, wondering what is about to unfold..._
  
  - _The king rises from his seat and exclaims "Whosoever makes me laugh today will have my kingdom tomorrow." Gasps flush throughout the room as the king makes his announcement. An elderly member of the roundtable breaks the silence "My king, what do you mean?" The king closes his eyes gently and takes a deep breath, then seating himself once more. Finally opening his eyes the king explains "The court cannot go on without amusement. At this point I am willing to put my kingdom on the line for some hearty laughter. Therefore I propose we hold a contest of sorts - to see who is worthy enough to hold court in my stead."_
  
  - _[The king then goes on to explain the rules of the game]_

- **Components:**
  
  - **smartphone/tablet/laptop** - 1 for each player
  
  - **a chat room** - to share act materials if needed
  
  - **amusing materials** - what each person wants to share
  
  - **pen and paper** - for the king
  
  - **a coin** - to toss to decide the first king

- **Aim of Game:** Make the king's court laugh and become the king for a day (round)

- **Setup:**
  
  - **Deciding the first king:**
    
    - everyone calls Heads or Tails
      - there must be at least one person calling something different. i.e. if everyone calls Heads/Tails, the game cannot proceed
    - a coin is flipped
    - those who called right flip again
    - `loop till two players remain`
    - winner of last coin flip becomes the king
  
  - king takes pen and paper to keep tally of points
  
  - players sit in a circle or at a table (preferably round)
  
  - all players prepare materials for their act
    
    - each player gathers jokes and media to present
    
    - they gather the material on their phones
    
    - king gathers material for 2 acts; others for 3 acts
    
    - the same player cannot become king more than once
    
    - the same joke or material cannot be used by anyone else
      
      - e.g. if someone plays "rickroll", it cannot be used for the rest of the game (even in following rounds, or by the same player)

- **Game Progression:**
  
  - king picks another player at random and asks **"Jest or Share?"**
  
  - the player becomes designated the **Jester** till the end of their act
  
  - the jester chooses to present their act to the court - either:
    
    - _tell a joke_
    
    - _share some funny media (meme, video, drawing, image, etc.)_
  
  - the jester presents their act to the court
  
  - _the court laughs (hopefully)_
  
  - the king asks the court **"Who is amused?"** (or something like that)
  
  - the court (except the jester) votes by raising their hands
  
  - the king tallies points for the jester:
    
    - 1 point for each court member amused
    
    - 3 points for amusing the king
  
  - if the jester cannot (or chooses not to) tell a joke within the alloted time (5 minutes, or 7 for accessibility needs), the **lifeline** extra activates
    
    - if they cannot invoke a **lifeline**, they are **silenced**
    
    - **silenced** players are not allowed to vote for the duration of the round and all jesters prior and afterwards get their vote (+1 for all jesters that round except the silenced ones)
  
  - `loop to the first point`
    
    - this goes on until each court member except the king has performed an act exactly once
    
    - after that, the king shares the tally with the court and declares the king for the next day (1 game day = 1 round in reality)
    
    - next king is whoever has the highest points (if this is a prior king, the next person in line is chosen)
    
    - next round's order of jesters isn't by the king's decision - whoever has the lowest points goes first, and so on (this is to give them a chance for redemption)

- **Resolution:**
  
  - all rounds complete
  - no win or loss, only fun

- **Extras:**
  
  - **Lifeline:** _If the jester fails to amuse **any** court member other than the king, they may choose to say a **one-liner** as a last attempt to make the court laugh. Stakes are higher and there is **no prep time**, so **points are doubled** for each laughter except the king's._
    
    - the one-liner must be no longer than 1 sentence
  
  - **Inclusivity:** Personally attacking acts and materials are not condoned. If anyone presents such materials they are disqualified from the game and may be suggested to seek rehabilitation.
